										<p>Outside of work, I am an avid outdoorsman, enjoy spending time with my family, and learning new things to help me in my academic, professional, and personal lives.</p>

On the <a href="code.html">code</a> page, you will find links to some software that I have developed as part of the pWeb Project, as well as a game I created in JavaScript, which I have released as free software as well.</p>

							<h3>My Bio</h3>
							
							<p>My interest in computers began in primary school when my family bought a Dell i386 with Windows 3.0a.  At the beginning of high school, I bought used computer parts off the Internet, and assembled my own server.  I taught myself how to use Linux and program in PHP, and made several websites in high school.</p>
								
							<p>Since that young age, my interest in computers and programming has developed from creating websites with my friends to pursuing a Masters degree and career in the field.  I graduated from The University of Western Ontario with an Honors Specialization in Computer Science and a Major in Physics with distinction.  A few months after I graduated, I began work at Research In Motion - now BlackBerry - as a Software Developer for BlackBerry Infrastructure.  In 2012, I decided to pursue a graduate degree in Computer Science, and will be completing my Masters degree this year.

						<h3>Outdoors</h3>
						
						<p>When I'm not doing research or writing code, my passion is to be outside and experience the great outdoors.  I enjoy going on long bike rides (London to Toronto being the longest so far), and regularly canoe through Algonquin Park, where I have spent many trips exploring the interior of one of the most beautiful provincial parks in Ontario.</p>

						<h3>Research Project</h3>
						
						<p>I am currently researching Internet censorship from a technical and human rights perspective. This research will form the basis of my Master's research paper, and I am also aiming to publish a survey paper on the topic.

						<h3>pWeb </h3>
						
						<p> Since starting graduate studies in 2012, I have been working with a small, dedicated team of researchers led by Dr. Raouf Boutaba at the University of Waterloo to develop a system called pWeb. The pWeb Project aims to create a state- of-the-art peer-to-peer web hosting infrastructure that is capable of supporting emerging Web technologies such as WebSockets and HTML5 features.</p>

						<h3>Past Research</h3>
						
						<p>My undergraduate thesis allowed me to investigate dynamic resource management in a datacenter.  This thesis, entitled Dynamic Resource Management using Operating System-Level Virtualization, was an extension of Ph.D. candidate Gastón Keller’s Master’s thesis that investigated the dynamic provisioning of processor time across all virtual machines hosted in a datacenter.</p>
