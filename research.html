						<h2>Research</h2>

						<p>I enjoy the challenge of solving problems and doing original research that can have an impact.
							I have been actively involved in research since beginning my undergraduate degree. Below are
							descriptions of some of the projects that I have worked with links to my publications.</p>
						
						<h3>Internet Censorship and Circumvention</h3>
						
						<p>I am currently researching Internet censorship from a techtical and human rights perspective. 
							This research will form the basis of my Master's research paper, and I am also aiming to publish
							a survey paper on the topic.</p>
							
						<h3>pWeb: A Personal Interface to the World Wide Web</h3>
						<!-- link to website, paper, technical reports -->
						
						<h3>Dynamic Resource Management using Golondrina</h3>
						<p> I started the research that led to the paper “Managing dynamic memory allocations in a cloud through
							Golondrina” in the summer of 2009 when I received an NSERC USRA that enabled me to team up with
							Dr. Hanan Lutfiyya and Ph.D. candidate Gastón Keller to investigate dynamic resource management in a
							datacenter. This work was an extension of Keller’s Master’s thesis that investigated the dynamic
							provisioning of processor time across all virtual machines hosted in a datacenter. My contribution was to
							extend this work to include heuristics for allocating main memory in addition to processor time. My
							heuristics attempted to identify and resolve resource stress situations by first searching for local
							solutions, such as adjusting the ratio of memory allocated to virtual machines hosted on a single physical
							machine, and failing that, by searching for a global solution, such as redistributing virtual machines
							across physical machines through one or more migrations. I continued to work on this project through
							the school year and evaluated my implementation of a policy-based resource management framework on
							a small cluster at the university. My background research, implementation and experimental results
							formed the basis of my undergraduate honors thesis. I published this paper based on our research after
							I graduated. I also presented this paper at the 4th International Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF)
							Academic Alliance Workshop on Systems and Virtualization Management.

						<h3>Undergraduate Summer Research</h3>
						<p>I have been the recipient of several undergraduate student research awards that enabled me to work
							with talented professors as a research assistant. In 2008 I participated in the Summer Student 
							Program at the Space Telescope Science Institute which is operated by the Association of Universities
							for Research in Astronomy for NASA. I worked with Drs. Alberto Conti and Carol Christian to 
							successfully develop a Web service that automatically searches for and displays information about
							celestial bodies visible in Google Sky.</p>
							
						<p>In the summer of 2007 I worked with Dr. Todd Simpson to develop calibration software for the LEO 1530
							field emission scanning electron microscope in the University of Western Ontario Nanofabrication
							Laboratory. I worked with Dr. Willy Lennard during the summer of 2006 to redesign Quark, a software
							package for simulating Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (a form of ion beam analysis) and
							operated the Tandetron particle accelerator to determine the structure and composition of unknown
							materials.</p>
