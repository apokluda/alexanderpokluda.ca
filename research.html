						<h2>Research</h2>

						<p>I enjoy the challenge of solving problems and doing original research that can have an impact.
							I have been actively involved in research since beginning my undergraduate degree. Below are
							descriptions of some of the projects that I have worked with links to my publications.
						</p>
						
						<h3 id="censorship">Internet Censorship and Circumvention</h3>
						
						<p>I am currently researching Internet censorship from a technical and human rights perspective. 
							This research will form the basis of my Master's research paper, and I am also aiming to publish
							a survey paper on the topic.
						</p>
							
						<h3 id="pweb">pWeb: A Personal Interface to the World Wide Web</h3>
						<p>My research interests lie primarily in the fields of computer networks and distributed systems
							and how these technologies can be used to support the common good. Since starting graduate studies
							in 2012, I have been working with a small, dedicated team of researchers led by Dr. Raouf Boutaba at
							the University of Waterloo to develop a system called pWeb. The pWeb Project aims to create a state-
							of-the-art peer-to-peer web hosting infrastructure that is capable of supporting emerging Web
							technologies such as WebSockets and HTML5 features. We have designed pWeb from the ground up to
							provide a multimedia-rich user experience that rivals the contemporary client-server hosting
							infrastructure.
						</p>
							
						<p>A few systems exist or have been proposed that share some similarities with pWeb; however,
							none of these share the all of the same goals. <a href="http://www.coralcdn.org/">CoralCDN</a>
							is a hybrid system that uses a peer-to-peer network of caches to reduce the load on a centralized
							Web server but does not provide dynamic content hosting nor does it focus on censorship resistance.
							<a href="http://freenetproject.org/">Freenet</a> is a distributed data store that has a lot in
							common with the first generation of pWeb but it is an older system that has not been designed for
							modern challenges; as a result, content can be slow to access and dynamic pages are not supported.
							This is a timely project with the potential for high impact as online surveillance and censorship
							are growing in scale, scope and sophistication around the world. pWeb will help shape debate from a
							technical perspective, enhance democracy and preserve free speech online, maintaining the Web as a
							place of informed public debate.
						</p>
							
						<p>The pWeb technical reports describe in detail the development of the architecture, design, and
							implementation of the pWeb peer-to-peer Web hosting system. I prepared these reports for publication on the David
							R. Cheriton School of Computer Science website based on internal deliverables produced for Orange
							Labs, our industry sponsor, that were comprised of research, software and documentation. pWeb consists
							of four main software components: the Home Agent, DNS Gateway, Crawler and client software. 
							For the work that led to the final deliverable, I completed research that led to the design of the
							DNS Gateway that provides a DNS interface to the pWeb device naming system. I drew on my industry
							experience as I implemented a production quality version of the Gateway from scratch according to the
							DNS protocol specification and evaluated the performance of a global, location-aware deployment. My
							research also led to the development of the Crawler—a component that traverses the graph of Home
							Agents in the pWeb Plexus network and indexes device and content metadata to construct a searchable
							database of all devices and content hosted in the system. In June 2013, I flew to France to present the
							results of our research at Orange Lab’s facility in Paris. The paper pWeb: A Personal Interface to the
							World Wide Web encompasses our latest research and includes an evaluation of the scalability and 
							performance of the Crawler on a simulated global deployment of nearly 30,000 Home Agents supporting 2 
							billion simulated mobile devices. A public deployment of pWeb is accessible though the website
							<a href="http://www.pwebproject.net/">pwebproject.net</a> and the DNS Gateway and Crawler are available
							as <a href="code.html#pweb">free software</a>. This research is significant because Orange
							(formerly France Télécom) may use some of the results in future products and services and pWeb has
							the potential to revolutionize Web hosting as we know it by giving end users virtually unlimited
							resources to publish and host content.

						<h3 id="golondrina">Dynamic Resource Management using Golondrina</h3>
						<p> I started the research that led to the paper “Managing dynamic memory allocations in a cloud through
							Golondrina” in the summer of 2009 when I received an NSERC USRA that enabled me to team up with
							Dr. Hanan Lutfiyya and Ph.D. candidate Gastón Keller to investigate dynamic resource management in a
							datacenter. This work was an extension of Keller’s Master’s thesis that investigated the dynamic
							provisioning of processor time across all virtual machines hosted in a datacenter. My contribution was to
							extend this work to include heuristics for allocating main memory in addition to processor time. My
							heuristics attempted to identify and resolve resource stress situations by first searching for local
							solutions, such as adjusting the ratio of memory allocated to virtual machines hosted on a single physical
							machine, and failing that, by searching for a global solution, such as redistributing virtual machines
							across physical machines through one or more migrations. I continued to work on this project through
							the school year and evaluated my implementation of a policy-based resource management framework on
							a small cluster at the university. My background research, implementation and experimental results
							formed the basis of my undergraduate honors thesis. I published this paper based on our research after
							I graduated. I also presented this paper at the 4th International Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF)
							Academic Alliance Workshop on Systems and Virtualization Management.

						<h3>Undergraduate Summer Research</h3>
						<p>I have been the recipient of several undergraduate student research awards that enabled me to work
							with talented professors as a research assistant. In 2008 I participated in the Summer Student 
							Program at the Space Telescope Science Institute which is operated by the Association of Universities
							for Research in Astronomy for NASA. I worked with Drs. Alberto Conti and Carol Christian to 
							successfully develop a Web service that automatically searches for and displays information about
							celestial bodies visible in Google Sky.</p>
							
						<p>In the summer of 2007 I worked with Dr. Todd Simpson to develop calibration software for the LEO 1530
							field emission scanning electron microscope in the University of Western Ontario Nanofabrication
							Laboratory. I worked with Dr. Willy Lennard during the summer of 2006 to redesign Quark, a software
							package for simulating Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (a form of ion beam analysis) and
							operated the Tandetron particle accelerator to determine the structure and composition of unknown
							materials.</p>
